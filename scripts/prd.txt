# Overview  
DeepFlow is a deep work tracking and focus management website with a cyberpunk aesthetic. It helps users track their deep work sessions, visualize their progress with a stylized contribution heatmap, and manage their focus states with immersive cyberpunk-themed UI elements. DeepFlow is designed for knowledge workers, programmers, writers, and anyone who wants to track and improve their deep work habits while enjoying a visually engaging experience.

# Core Features  
1. **Cyberpunk Heatmap Visualization**
   - Interactive contribution-style heatmap tracking deep work sessions
   - Custom cyberpunk-themed activity levels (Ghost Mode, Data Drifter, Synthwave Flow, etc.)
   - Color-coded intensity based on focus duration/productivity
   - Animated hover effects with session details

2. **Focus Session Timer**
   - Customizable Pomodoro-style timer with cyberpunk theming
   - Multiple focus intensity presets (e.g., "Neural Sync", "Deep Dive", "Overclock")
   - Visual and audio cues for session start/end/breaks
   - Session logging and categorization

3. **Digital Dashboard**
   - Summary statistics of focus sessions and productivity
   - Streak tracking and personal records
   - Customizable cyberpunk interface with glowing elements
   - Dark mode by default with neon accent colors

4. **User Experience**
   - No login required - data stored in local storage
   - Offline functionality
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Keyboard shortcuts for power users

# User Experience  
## Primary User: Deep Work Practitioners
- Knowledge workers wanting to track focus sessions
- Programmers, writers, designers, and students
- Users who appreciate cyberpunk aesthetics and gamification

## Key User Flows
1. Start a new focus session with timer
2. Review daily/weekly/monthly contribution heatmap
3. Analyze personal productivity trends
4. Customize workspace and session settings

## UI/UX Considerations
- Dark background with neon blue/purple/teal accents
- Glowing elements and subtle animations
- Circuit board patterns and cyberpunk visual motifs
- Clean, minimalist layout with immersive details

# Technical Architecture  
## Frontend
- Next.js framework for static site generation and frontend
- React for component-based UI development
- CSS modules or Tailwind CSS for styling
- Local storage for saving user data without backend
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Animation libraries (Framer Motion) for cyberpunk effects

## Components
- HeatmapGrid: Main visualization component
- FocusTimer: Session management component
- StatsPanel: User metrics and analytics
- SettingsModal: User preferences
- CyberpunkUI: Theme components (buttons, cards, etc.)

## Data Model
- Session: {id, date, duration, category, intensity, notes}
- Settings: {theme, timerDefaults, soundEnabled, notifications}
- Stats: {dailyTotals, streaks, records}

## No Backend Requirements
- All data stored in browser's localStorage
- No authentication or user management needed
- No external API dependencies required

# Development Roadmap  
## MVP Phase
1. Basic page structure and cyberpunk styling
2. Contribution heatmap with mock data
3. Simple focus timer functionality
4. Local storage integration
5. Essential UI components with cyberpunk styling

## Enhancement Phase
1. Advanced timer features (custom intervals, different modes)
2. Enhanced heatmap interactions and animations
3. Stats dashboard with basic analytics
4. Settings and customization options
5. Keyboard shortcuts and productivity enhancements

## Polish Phase
1. Advanced animations and visual effects
2. Sound effects and optional background audio
3. Additional cyberpunk theming options
4. Performance optimizations
5. Progressive Web App capabilities

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Core UI Framework and Layout (foundation)
   - Setup Next.js project
   - Implement basic page structure
   - Create cyberpunk theme system

2. Heatmap Visualization (core feature)
   - Implement basic grid structure
   - Add mock data visualization
   - Style with cyberpunk elements
   - Add interactive features

3. Timer Functionality (user interaction)
   - Build basic timer component
   - Implement session tracking
   - Connect to local storage
   - Add cyberpunk styling

4. Dashboard and Stats (derived feature)
   - Create stats calculations from session data
   - Build visualization components
   - Implement cyberpunk-themed charts and metrics

5. Settings and Customization (enhancement)
   - Create settings interface
   - Implement theme customization
   - Add user preferences

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- Creating responsive heatmap visualization
  - Mitigation: Use SVG or Canvas for flexible rendering
  
- Handling complex animations without performance issues
  - Mitigation: Use efficient animation libraries, throttle effects

- Local storage limitations
  - Mitigation: Implement data pruning and export/import features

## Scope Management
- Focus on core features for MVP
- Clearly define cyberpunk styling requirements
- Prioritize functionality over excessive visual effects

# Appendix  
## Cyberpunk Theme Elements
- Neon colors: Electric blue (#0ff), vibrant purple (#f0f), cyber green (#0f0)
- Dark backgrounds: Deep navy (#051b30), near black (#0a0b10)
- UI Patterns: Circuit traces, digital glitches, terminal-style text
- Typography: Monospace for data, futuristic san-serif for headers

## Reference Implementation
- Heatmap inspiration: GitHub contribution calendar
- Timer inspiration: Pomodoro technique with 25/5 minute intervals
- Visual inspiration: Cyberpunk 2077, Blade Runner, The Matrix
